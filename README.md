# MicToMorse

MicToMorse is an accessibility-focused project designed to help people with disabilities, such as quadriplegics who do not have the ability to speak, communicate by making simple sounds into a microphone. These sounds are converted into **Morse code (dots and dashes)** and then translated into **text**, with an optional **push-to-speak** feature for voice output.

## 🌐 Live Demo
A public version of the project is available here:  
👉 [MicToMorse Live](https://mictomorse.pages.dev)

No installation is required - just open the link in your browser, allow microphone access, and start communicating.
